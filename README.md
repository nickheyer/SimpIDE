# SimpIDE
A super-simple IDE.

This started as a personal project, but quickly evolved into something I think others may appreciate. 
This IDE uses Tkinter libraries, as well as publically available "lexers" which define syntax highlighting for a variety of languages. As of right now, it even supports "running" the targeted script (given that it's a .py or .cpp). 

Installation:
Download and run SimpIDE_Setup.exe
